# NeuralNets_Project

## Project workflow
1. Read in csv file
2. Filter unavailable url
3. Create dataloader
4. Augment Images
5. Define Model
6. Train Model
7. Evaluate Model
8. Saliency Map
9. Class Activation Map


## data folder
Store original dataset downloaded form kaggle where csv files have url link for image with prices / categories etc.

## images folder
Output images such as price histograms, loss per epoch etc.

## output folder
Output trained model parameters / downloaded information on images and stored by each category.
